input[type="password"] {
    
} -> attribute selector, select only the input field with password type

border-radius: 10px; -> used to make the border more rounded 
border-radius: a b c d; -> can be used to make different types of borders

display: none;    -> removes the element
display: hidden;  -> hides the element but it still takes up space

box-shadow: xpx, ypx, opx; -> adds a shadow behind the element (opx -> opacity)
shadows can be different colors
